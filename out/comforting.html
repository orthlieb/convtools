<h1>Why Have a Comforting Conversation?</h1>
<p> Everyone needs to be comforted at times, the book of Psalms has many
  examples of how to comfort yourself in the Lord and return to peace and
  joy.
  <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+16%3A11&version=NLT">Psalms 16:11</a> </p>
<p> You can engage in a comforting conversation with the Lord yourself or
  have someone guide you through it. </p>
<p> A comforting conversation is a way of teaching someone to calm
  themselves when they are in distress.
  <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms+131%3A2&version=NLT">Psalms 131:2</a> </p>
<p> A comforting conversation will help someone focus their thoughts on the
  Lord so they can bring every thought captive and ﬁnd peace of mind once
  again.
  <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+26%3A3&version=NLT">Isaiah 26:3</a> </p>
<p> This conversation can prevent painful experiences from becoming traumas.
</p>
<h1>When to Have a Comforting Conversation?</h1>
<p> The time to use a comforting conversation is when a person such as your
  wife, child or a person you are coaching is in distress over an issue that
  does not necessarily involve you directly. It may also be necessary when
  you ﬁnd yourself in distress and you need to encourage yourself in the
  Lord like David did throughout his life.
  <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms+27%3A10-11&version=NLT">Psalms 27:10-11</a> </p>
<h1> How Do I Have a Comforting Conversation?</h1>
<p> We comfort people with the comfort we have received from the Lord.
  <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=II+Corinthians+1%3A3-4&version=NLT">II Corinthians 1:3-4</a> </p>
<p> We comfort people by leading them back to the throne of grace so they
  can be connected to God once again.
  <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+4%3A15-16&version=NLT">Hebrews 4:15-16</a> </p>
<p> We can comfort others as we receive consolation from the Lord and then
  willingly offer it to others.
  <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+2%3A1&version=NLT">Philippians 2:1</a> </p>
<p> Start with the six questions that follow and then explore the five GREAT
  steps to freedom. </p>

        Discover the question that is causing the mind to search for answers. Often times Satan will use a question in order to capture our thoughts. Satan used this scheme when he asked Eve a question while in the Garden of Eden. He took her thoughts
        captive with a question.

        Men can often be
        <b>deceived</b>
        with false information but women are often
        <b>beguiled</b>
        when they are given just a few facts and left to ﬁll in the rest with a story of their own imagination.
        <br>
        You can ask, "What happened?" and "What are you telling yourself?" if they can't detect the question they are asking themselves.

        Satan is a deceiver and the father of lies, he will try to capture your thoughts ﬁrst, then he will help you create a story ﬁlled with half truths, lies and accusations so he can capture your emotions and ﬁnally your will. He wants you to make unwise
        choices based on F.E.A.R. so he can kill your body, rob you of your ﬁnances, and destroy your relationships.

        <img style="width: 100%;" title="R" alt="Real" src="images/comforting/FEAR-R.png">
        <br>It becomes a story when we do not have all the facts and we need to ﬁll in the gaps with our own imagination or the accuser of the brethren helps us ﬁll in the gaps with his F.E.A.R.
        <br>
        <b>It is not the facts that create the emotion, it is the story we create around the facts.
        </b>
        <br>The meaning determines the feeling. We need to be aware of the meaning we are attaching to the facts and then challenge that meaning with the truth. Often times it means seeking counsel from others so we can recognize reality and allow truth to
          set us free.

            David would pour out his heart unto the Lord, by expressing the facts as he saw them, by letting God know the questions that were going through his mind and the answers he was telling himself.
            <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+42%3A4&version=NLT">Psalms 42:4</a>
          </li>

            He would express his feelings until he knew the Lord had considered his troubles and knew his soul in adversity
            <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+31%3A7-8&version=NLT">Psalm 31:7-8</a>
            <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+62%3A8&version=NLT">Psalm 62:8</a>
            and when he would ﬁnish he would say, "Why art thou cast down, O my soul? Hope thou in God, for I shall yet praise him!
            <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms+42%3A5&version=NLT">Psalms 42:5</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            Perfect love will cast out fear and when fear is cast out the need for control will subside. Fear is often based on false evidence that appears real. Our natural inclinations when we experience fear is to either ﬁght, take ﬂight or freeze.
            <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+14%3A12&version=NLT">Proverbs 14:12</a>

          <li>
            When we are acting out of fear we are accessing the small rear part of our brain designed for quick survival thinking and when we are being relational we are accessing the large frontal lobes where our relational circuits are found.</li>
          <li>Science has recently discovered what God has been prescribing all along, in order to switch from the survival mode functions of the middle of the brain to the relational mode of the frontal lobes you need to start with a process called deliberate
            appreciation.

  The following process prescribed by God and often demonstrated throughout scripture, especially by David in the Psalms, will help us move from a distressed mindset into a calm relational mindset. We will have been transformed by the renewing of our
  mind.

      There is a progression by which we come into God's presence and into His throne of grace. We come boldly because of the blood of Jesus that has made us holy and blameless.
