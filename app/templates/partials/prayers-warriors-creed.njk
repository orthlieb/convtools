  I am more than a conqueror in Christ Jesus, a member of a chosen generation. I serve the people of a holy nation and I live out the Kingdom
  values. I will always place the will of my Lord and Savior first. I will never accept defeat, for by my God I can run through a troop and by my God I can leap over a wall. I will never quit, though I stumble and fall seven times I will rise up. I will
  fight for my brethren, for my sons and my daughters, my wife, and my King. <br>
  <br> I take up my helmet of salvation; I put on my breastplate of righteousness; I gird myself with the belt of truth, and having my feet shod with the gospel of peace; I take up my sword of the Spirit and my shield of faith. I am strong in the grace
  that is in Christ Jesus. <br>
  <br> I endure hardness as a good soldier. I do not entangle myself with the affairs of this life that I may please Him Who has chosen me to be a soldier. I have consecrated myself unto the Lord, therefore He will do amazing things in and through me.
  <br>
  <br> The Lord shall cause my enemies that rise up against me to be smitten before my face: they shall come against me one way, and flee before me seven ways. I bring every thought captive to the obedience of Christ and tear down strongholds and principalities
  by the power of God that works mightily within me. <br>
  <br> I know my God; I am strong and I do great exploits. I am courageous; I do not fear the terror of night, nor the arrow that flies by day. A thousand may fall at my side, ten thousand at my right hand, but it will not come near me because I have
  made the Most High my dwelling; He is my refuge. <br>
  <br> I love the Lord and acknowledge His name; He is with me in trouble and I know He will deliver me. I am a Soldier of the King.
