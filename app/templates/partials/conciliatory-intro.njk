<h2 class="conciliatory-text">Why Have a Conciliatory Conversation?</h1>
Conciliatory conversations are important because they remove guilt so we can
love from a pure heart, a good conscience and a sincere faith. If we don't
properly deal with guilt then we will seek to justify ourselves. <br>
<br>
The main way we justify ourselves is through blame, which leads to the
stronghold of resentment, which leads to despising and eventually it becomes
a root of bitterness. <br>
<br>
The conciliatory conversation will free us from guilt and bitterness that
comes from an unforgiving heart. When we ask forgiveness we are keeping
short accounts, we are not building up overdue emotional debt that needs
reconciled. See <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+4%3A32&version=NLT">Ephesians 4:32</a>
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+18%3A21-35&version=NLT">Matthew 18:21-35</a> (Parable
of the Unmerciful Servant), <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+11%3A25&version=NLT">Mark 11:25</a>

You will receive the level of honor according to the level of humility you
go to. In this conversation there are four levels of an apology as well as
four degrees of humility. Jesus shows us how to esteem the needs of others
as higher than our own in

as he humbled himself by becoming a man, then a servant,
then a public scourging and death on a cross, now his name is above every
other name. The law of the universe dictates that humility comes before
honor. <br>
<h2 class="conciliatory-text">When to Have a Conciliatory Conversation</h1>
When we realize we have sinned against someone or offended a person and we
need to leave our gift at the altar and make things right with man before
continuing our worship before God. Unforgiveness can keep us linked to the
pain of the past versus releasing people and cutting off the enemy's attacks
through forgiving one another. <br>
<h2 class="conciliatory-text">How to Have a Conciliatory Conversation </h1>
Often times we only deal with the surface problem and we argue about the
interpretation of one another's actions and intentions. Forgiveness is not
justifying, forgetting, excusing or denying the pain of someone's sin nor is
it not counting men's sins against them.
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=II+Corinthians+5%3A18-19&version=NLT">II Corinthians 5:18-19</a> Forgiveness is an act of the will in
which we choose to give up our right to hold another person accountable for
the wrong they have done to us. We cannot hold unto a person in order to
settle the score. Forgiveness is letting go and releasing a person from any
future claims against them. <br>
<br>
Ultimately, you need to determine the Four Levels of the Problem and go
through the Four Levels of Forgiveness.
