    <h2 class="red">Husband's Prayer</h2>
    <p>
      Lord,
    </p>
    <p>
      I am willing to be made willing by Your grace. Give me the ear of the wise. Help me to understand my wife and live with her in understanding, that our prayers would not be hindered, and that we would be able to resolve every issue that comes up.
      Enable us to cast all these burdens on You. So Lord, I choose to be a willing man. I&#8217;m scared. I&#8217;m afraid. I don&#8217;t know what I am going to face in this conversation. But Lord, give me the grace to be strong in the power of Your
      might.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amen

    <p>
      Lord,
    </p>
    <p>
      I give you myself, and ask that You would give me the words to speak to my husband, that I would not tear him down, but that we would be able to walk through this issue together. Give me sweetness of lips, but also let me express what is going on in
      my heart, so that I can sense that he knows me, and that You know me. I want to be able to glorify You, Father, and at the end of this conversation to be able to say, &#8220;I praise You, Lord, for You have heard my voice.&#8221; So, I receive now
      the tongue of the learned to speak the words that we need to talk about right now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amen
