<h4>Why Have a Connecting Conversation?</h4>
<p>You want to be intentional in maintaining a strong connection. Mutual self-revelation is the way to developing connection and intimacy. In-to-me-see is one definition that explains what we are all asking for in relationship. We want to be known
  and not alone.You are updating your love map of each other when you connect on all 9 levels.

<h4>When to Have a Connecting Conversation?</h4>
<p>You will want to have these on a regular basis or when you or your wife are feeling disconnected.
</p>
<h4>How Do I Have a Connecting Conversation?</h4>
<p>Safety, honesty, and vulnerability are necessary for connecting conversations. The key to becoming irresistible is not how interesting we are but how interested we are. Become curious about one another and don't be threatened by the change that
  takes place when people grow. Change is inevitable but growth is optional.
</p>
<p>The speed by which you move through the levels of connection is determined by the degree of trust you have and the safety you are providing one another to be vulnerable. Each level requires greater risk but comes with greater rewards. When you
  stay at the first three levels it is less risky like putting money in a bank or CD at 1% but at least you're' not losing capital.
</p>
<p>
  Angry foolish reactions take huge emotional withdrawls. You can casually go through each level by asking a question related to the level or you can choose a topic to connect on and go through each level within the context of the topic. i.e.(children,
  finances, chores, sex, upcoming trip)
