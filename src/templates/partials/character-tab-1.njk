  <h4>What Is Character?</h4>
  <p>Character is the inward motivation to do what is right according to the highest standards of behavior in every situation. Character consists of the stable and distinctive qualities built into an individual&rsquo;s life that determine his or her
    responses, regardless of the circumstances. Character is the wise response to the pressure of a difficult situation and what we do when we think that no one is watching. It is the predictor of good behavior.</p>
  <h4>Character Qualities</h4>
  <p>The Greek word for character is
    <i>charakter</i>. It is translated in Scripture as the &ldquo;express image.&rdquo; According to The Complete Word Study Dictionary New Testament, the word &ldquo;originally denoted an engraver or engraving tool. Later it meant the impression itself,
    usually something engraven, cut in, or stamped, a character, letter, mark, [or] sign. This impression with its particular features was considered as the exact representation of the object whose image it bore.&rdquo; In Hebrews 1:3, Christ is referred
    to as the &ldquo;express image&rdquo; of God; He fully expressed the character of God through His life.</p>
  <p>
    One of God&rsquo;s primary goals for believers is to transform them into the image of His Son so that they may be a reflection of the character of Christ. We can take comfort in this purpose when we experience difficulties because &ldquo;We know that
    all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose&rdquo;
